# Fnord

Fnord is a command line tool the builds a searchable database of your files,
using AI-generated embeddings to index and search your code base, notes, and
other (non-binary) files.

## Installation

```bash
# Elixir is required
brew install elixir

# Install the script
mix escript.install github sysread/fnord
```

## Usage

### Indexing

The first time you run this, especially on a large codebase, it will take a
while to index everything. Subsequent runs will be faster, re-indexing only
those files which have changed since they were last indexed.

```bash
fnord index --project foo --dir /path/to/foo
```

You can **reindex** the project, forcing it to reindex all files:

```bash
fnord index --project foo --dir /path/to/foo --reindex
```

### Searching

```bash
fnord search --project foo --query "some search query"
```

If you want more detail about each file matched:

```bash
fnord search --project foo --query "some search query" --detail
```
